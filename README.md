# AirBnB-Data-Analytics-project
As part of a strategic initiative, a valued client within the real estate sector has entrusted me with the task of conducting a thorough analysis of Airbnb listings in the vibrant Dallas, Texas area. The objective is to provide insights that will empower our client to make successful investment decisions within the Airbnb ecosystem.
In this project, I would be analyzing AirBnB listing dataset specifically in Dallas, Texas area to gain date driven insight, on basically the factors that may contribute to having a successful AirBnB listing.

## Ask Phase
1. How do we make accurate decisions on the best approach to take, in order to create successful AirBnB listings? 
My strategy includes:
-  Make a list of the top ten most successful hosts, and analyze their overal revenue.
-  Analyzing Districts and areas with the higest turn out.
-   dentify the most popular accomodation category.

## Prepare Phase
1. Discription of all datasources used:
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), a website called 'Inside Airbnb' a third-party public data-source. It consists of 18 columns ranging from the listing ID to license. Since it does not include the demograpic details of hosts, it is hard to determine of there are any bias. The dataset policy can be accessed [here](http://insideairbnb.com/data-policies)

<u>Import data into Excel & PowerQuery</u>
